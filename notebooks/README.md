# Jupyter Notebooks for Exploration and Analysis

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Prototyping new features or models.
- One-off analyses and investigations.
- Visualizing data and results.

Notebooks should be named descriptively, often with a numerical prefix if they represent a sequence of exploration (e.g., `01_initial_eda.ipynb`, `02_feature_prototyping.ipynb`).

While notebooks are excellent for interactive work, try to refactor reusable code into scripts in the `src/` directory for better version control, testing, and inclusion in automated pipelines.
