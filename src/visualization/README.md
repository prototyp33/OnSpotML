# Visualization Scripts

This module can contain Python scripts dedicated to generating specific visualizations or plots, especially those that are part of a repeatable pipeline or report generation process.

While exploratory visualization is often done in Jupyter Notebooks (`notebooks/`), scripts here can be used for:
- Generating standard plots for model evaluation.
- Creating figures for automated reports.
- Complex visualizations that benefit from being in a script format.

**Note:** If visualization is primarily done ad-hoc in notebooks, this directory might remain sparse.
