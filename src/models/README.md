# Model Training and Prediction Scripts

This module will contain scripts related to training machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and using them for predictions.

**Potential Scripts (Examples for future development):**
- `train_occupancy_model.py`: Script for training a parking occupancy prediction model.
- `evaluate_model.py`: Script for evaluating model performance against test data.
- `predict_occupancy.py`: Script or module for generating predictions using a trained model.
- `hyperparameter_tuning.py`: Scripts for optimizing model hyperparameters.
