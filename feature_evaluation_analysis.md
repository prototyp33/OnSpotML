# Feature Evaluation for OnSpotML Barcelona Parking System

## 🏆 **HIGH PRIORITY** - Implement Immediately

### **Detailed Weather Variables** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status**: ✅ Already partially implemented with Open-Meteo

**Additional Recommendations**:
- ✅ **Wind speed** - Already have (`wind_kph`)
- ✅ **Temperature** - Already have (`temp_c`) 
- ✅ **Precipitation** - Already have (`precip_mm`)
- 🔄 **Add**: Sunshine duration (Open-Meteo provides `sunshine_duration`)
- 🔄 **Add**: Weather severity classification (derive from `weather_code`)
- 🔄 **Add**: Thunderstorm detection (weather_code >= 95)

**Implementation**: Easy extension of current Open-Meteo integration
**Expected Impact**: High - Weather strongly affects walking willingness

### **Refined Temporal Patterns** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status**: ✅ Partially implemented

**Current**: Hour, day_of_week, weekends, holidays
**Add**:
- 🔄 **30-minute intervals** - Higher granularity for peak detection
- 🔄 **School holidays** - Barcelona academic calendar
- 🔄 **Business hours classification** - 9-18h vs off-peak
- 🔄 **Day transitions** - Bridge days between holidays/weekends

**Implementation**: Easy - temporal feature engineering
**Expected Impact**: High - Time patterns are fundamental

## 🥈 **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Implement Next

### **Event-Specific Temporal Variables** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status**: ✅ Basic events implemented (`is_event_ongoing`)

**Enhance With**:
- 🔄 **Pre-event windows** - 1h, 2h, 3h before events
- 🔄 **Post-event windows** - 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h after events  
- 🔄 **Event type classification** - Sporting vs cultural vs business
- 🔄 **Event scale** - Estimate attendance from venue capacity

**Data Sources**: 
- ✅ Already have cultural events
- 🔄 Add: FC Barcelona match schedule
- 🔄 Add: Concert venue schedules (Palau de la Música, etc.)

**Expected Impact**: High for areas near venues

### **Advanced Spatial Variables** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status**: ✅ Basic POI features implemented

**Enhance With**:
- 🔄 **Walking time calculations** - Not just distance, but actual walking time
- 🔄 **Multiple destination proximity** - Beach, shopping areas, business districts
- 🔄 **Micro-location details** - Street-level precision
- 🔄 **Building type density** - Residential vs commercial vs office

**Implementation**: Moderate - requires OSM routing and detailed POI mapping
**Expected Impact**: High - Location is key for parking choice

### **Traffic and Transportation Variables** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Status**: ✅ Basic GTFS features implemented

**Add**:
- 🔄 **Real-time metro status** - TMB API for service disruptions
- 🔄 **Traffic congestion levels** - Google Maps API or TomTom API
- 🔄 **Alternative transport pricing** - TMB ticket prices vs parking costs
- 🔄 **Rush hour intensity** - Traffic flow patterns

**Data Sources**: TMB real-time API, traffic APIs
**Expected Impact**: High - Transport alternatives strongly affect parking

## 🥉 **LOW PRIORITY** - Future Enhancements

### **Infrastructure and Capacity Details** ⭐⭐⭐
**Current**: Basic parking type (`TIPO`) and tariff (`TARIFA`)

**Add When Possible**:
- 🔄 **Indoor vs outdoor** - Weather protection premium
- 🔄 **Accessibility features** - Disabled spaces, family spaces
- 🔄 **EV charging availability** - Growing importance
- 🔄 **Security features** - CCTV, lighting, security patrols

**Challenge**: Requires detailed parking facility surveys
**Expected Impact**: Medium - Important for user preference

### **Dynamic Pricing Variables** ⭐⭐⭐
**Current**: Static tariff information

**Add**:
- 🔄 **Real-time pricing** - Dynamic rates during peak times
- 🔄 **Price elasticity** - Historical response to price changes
- 🔄 **Competitor pricing** - Nearby parking facilities

**Challenge**: Barcelona parking mostly has fixed pricing
**Expected Impact**: Medium-High where dynamic pricing exists

## ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED** - Skip These

### **Socioeconomic and Behavioral Factors** ⭐⭐
**Why Skip**:
- **Privacy concerns** - Individual behavior tracking problematic
- **Data availability** - Very difficult to obtain at scale
- **Implementation complexity** - Requires user tracking systems
- **GDPR compliance** - Privacy regulations in EU

### **IoT and Sensor-Based Variables** ⭐⭐
**Why Skip for Now**:
- **Infrastructure cost** - Requires sensor installation across Barcelona
- **Maintenance overhead** - Hardware reliability issues
- **Data integration complexity** - Real-time sensor data processing
- **Not under your control** - City infrastructure decision

### **Spillover Effects** ⭐⭐⭐
**Why Delay**:
- **Model complexity** - Requires multi-facility optimization
- **Data requirements** - Need comprehensive city-wide parking data
- **Implementation challenge** - Network effects modeling

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Implementation Roadmap**

### **Phase 1** (Next 2 weeks):
1. ✅ **Enhanced weather features** - Add sunshine, weather severity, thunderstorms
2. ✅ **30-minute temporal granularity** - Higher resolution time features
3. ✅ **School holiday calendar** - Barcelona academic year

### **Phase 2** (Next month):
1. 🔄 **Event timing windows** - Pre/post event features
2. 🔄 **Walking time calculations** - OSM routing integration
3. 🔄 **Real-time TMB status** - Transport disruption features

### **Phase 3** (Next quarter):
1. 🔄 **Traffic congestion data** - External traffic API
2. 🔄 **Advanced POI features** - Detailed destination analysis
3. 🔄 **Infrastructure details** - Parking facility characteristics

## 📊 **Expected Model Performance Impact**

| Feature Category | Current Accuracy | Expected Improvement | Implementation Effort |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Enhanced Weather | Baseline | +3-5% | Low |
| Refined Temporal | Baseline | +5-8% | Low |
| Event Windows | +2-3% | +4-6% | Medium |
| Advanced Spatial | +1-2% | +3-5% | Medium |
| Traffic Data | 0% | +2-4% | High |

**Total Expected Improvement**: +10-15% accuracy with full implementation

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Low-hanging fruit with high impact
2. **Measure incremental improvements** - A/B test each feature addition
3. **Focus on data availability** - Only implement what you can reliably collect
4. **Consider maintenance costs** - Choose sustainable data sources

The key is **incremental improvement** rather than trying to implement everything at once!
