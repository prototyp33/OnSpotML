# Project Configuration Files

This directory contains configuration files for the project, such as:
- Parameter settings for data processing or feature engineering.
- API keys or credentials (though `.env` is preferred for sensitive data).
- Model configurations.

Keeping configurations separate from code allows for easier adjustments without modifying scripts directly.
