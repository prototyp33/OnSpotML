## Most Important Variables for Predicting Parking Occupancy

Research and case studies consistently highlight several key variables that significantly improve the accuracy of machine learning models for parking occupancy prediction. These variables capture both the temporal, spatial, and contextual dynamics influencing parking demand.

---

### **1. Historical Occupancy Data**
- **Description:** Past occupancy rates or counts for each parking zone or lot.
- **Importance:** This is the most predictive variable, as parking occupancy exhibits strong temporal dependencies and patterns[1][2][3][6].
- **Typical Features:** 
  - Occupancy at previous time steps (lag features)
  - Rolling averages or trends

---

### **2. Temporal Variables**
- **Description:** Information about the time and date of prediction.
- **Importance:** Parking demand varies by hour, day, and season, reflecting work schedules, shopping hours, and special events[2][4][6].
- **Typical Features:** 
  - Time of day (hour, minute)
  - Day of week (weekday/weekend)
  - Date (for holidays, seasonality)
  - Public holiday or event indicator

---

### **3. Spatial Variables**
- **Description:** Characteristics and location of the parking zone or lot.
- **Importance:** Different areas (business, residential, recreational) have distinct parking patterns[2][6].
- **Typical Features:** 
  - Zone or lot ID
  - Geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude)
  - Proximity to points of interest (POIs)
  - Lot capacity or type (on/off-street, public/private)

---

### **4. Traffic Conditions**
- **Description:** Real-time or recent traffic data near the parking location.
- **Importance:** Traffic congestion can influence both parking demand and turnover rates; incorporating this data improves prediction accuracy[3][6].
- **Typical Features:** 
  - Traffic speed
  - Congestion index
  - Incident reports

---

### **5. Weather Conditions**
- **Description:** Meteorological data relevant to the prediction time and area.
- **Importance:** Weather affects driving behavior and parking demand, especially in recreational or outdoor locations[3][4][6].
- **Typical Features:** 
  - Temperature
  - Precipitation (rain, snow)
  - Wind speed
  - Weather type (categorical: clear, rainy, snowy, etc.)

---

### **6. Event Data**
- **Description:** Scheduled events (sports, concerts, festivals) near the parking area.
- **Importance:** Events can cause sudden surges in parking demand and are critical for accurate forecasting in affected zones[2][4].
- **Typical Features:** 
  - Event indicator (binary)
  - Event type and expected attendance
  - Event start/end time
  - Distance to event venue

---

### **7. Parking Attributes**
- **Description:** Physical and regulatory characteristics of the parking facility.
- **Importance:** Factors like price, time limits, and payment type can affect occupancy rates[2][5].
- **Typical Features:** 
  - Parking price
  - Payment method (metered, permit, free)
  - Time restrictions

### **Summary Table: Key Variables**

| Variable Group         | Example Features                                  | Importance Level         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Historical Occupancy  | Lagged occupancy, rolling mean                    | Critical                |
| Temporal              | Hour, day, holiday/event flag                     | Critical                |
| Spatial               | Zone ID, coordinates, POI proximity, lot type     | High                    |
| Traffic               | Speed, congestion, incidents                      | High                    |
| Weather               | Temperature, precipitation, weather type          | High                    |
| Event                 | Event flag, type, attendance, timing, distance    | High (in event areas)   |
| Parking Attributes    | Price, payment, restrictions                      | Medium                  |

### **Conclusion**

The **most important variables** are historical occupancy, temporal features (time, day, holiday/event), spatial context, traffic conditions, weather, and event data. Including these variables—especially historical occupancy, time, and event/traffic/weather context—has been shown in multiple studies to significantly enhance prediction accuracy for parking occupancy models[2][3][4][6].
